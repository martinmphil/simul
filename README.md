Using real [polyhedral dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Polyhedral_dice), this app typically runs on a tablet-computer lying flat on a gaming-table for all players to see.

Basically:-
* count the people on our side (Us),
* count the opposition (Them),
* enter the number of active players,
* app says which dice to roll.

Simulations cover any comparable measure (eg knights in an army, spaceships in opposing fleets, diplomats in rival trade missions, etc.) In this open-ended system "Us" and "Them" values can sum any number of units.

Summary
* JavaScript app for tabletop role-playing game
* Player-facing
* Co-operative
* Open-ended
* Simultaneous resolution of action

eg science-fiction :-

> The Commonwealth spanned a thousand light years. Yet losing the local jump-gate reinvented money. Now even comms cost cash. So the young pilot keeps his message short. "Hi Honey. I miss our life before the Navy. I wish I'd stayed freelance and never 'volunteered' for counter-espionage. Everyone's become so suspicious since The Attack. But reputation still opens doors and I found gangsters plotting to ransom our new gate so I'm trying to stop them. Happy hunting.
>
> Time passes faster for his girlfriend travelling near the speed of light. She'll jump straight home after reaching the next star towards the core – assuming nobody blows up the gate again – but he'll still appear decades older. Her ship holds one end of the first wormhole constructed for centuries and everyone knows the vital importance of rebuilding the gate. What kind of enemy appears from nowhere, strikes a devastating blow, and then vanishes?
>
> Spy drones slink forward as he copies his brain-state. Via the distant wormhole on his sweetheart's ship his censored message plays. "Hi Honey … beep …  Happy hunting."
