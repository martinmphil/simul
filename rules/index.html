  <li><p>Simultaneous resolution of action</li>
</ul>
<p>Using real dice and a tabletop computer-aid (eg tablet browser)
all players throw dice together after saying &quot;Ready, steady, roll!&quot;</p>

<h1 id="outline">Outline</h1>
<p>Build on contributions by saying “Yes, and...” </p>
<p>Characteristics record levels for strength, dexterity and
intelligence (where 10 represents human average).</p>
<p>Players state their intentions. </p>
<p>Reasonable plans normally progress without dice rolls. </p>
<p>Contentious actions may demand dice rolls modelling the chances
of players progressing ​​or suffering setbacks, eg <a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>:-</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>count the people on our side (Us), </p></li>
  <li>  <p>count the people opposing (Them), </p></li>
  <li><p>enter the number of active players, </p></li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them app</a>
    says which dice to roll. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="game_play">Game play</h1>
<p>Players <a href="#generating_characters">create
characters</a> and a <em>storyteller</em> (or Game Master or GM)
creates a game world around them with scenes, locations,
antagonists and supporting characters.
</p>
<p>Players describe their characters' intentions. The storyteller
narrates events and reactions.
</p>
<p>When investigating mysteries, storytellers should allow players
to progress lines of enquiry without rolling dice. Characters
looking in the right place and asking the right questions should
always find a clue.
</p>
<p>Contested actions may require dice rolls to determine progress.
If you feel inspired then feel free to suggest new dice mechanics.
Alternatively use <a href="#d99">d99</a>,
or our computerised <a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>
system.
</p>

<h1 id="us_vs_them">Us-vs-Them</h1>
<p><a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>
fosters party cooperation by asking players to roll dice in the
centre of the table at the same time, thus providing a
collaborative focus for the simultaneous resolution of actions.
</p>
<p>Players resolve actions concurrently. This avoids taking turns
in initiative order. Players simply state their intentions and roll
dice simultaneously.
</p>
<p>Reasonable plans proposed by players normally progress
automatically. As a rule of thumb only use
<a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>
dice mechanic for contested actions or when characters attempt
tasks harder than one in ten people might easily accomplish.</p>
<p>Only players roll dice, but the storyteller may choose to narrate results. </p>
<p>Players roll one dice each.</p>

<h2 id="order_of_play">Order of play</h2>
<p>Select number of participating players on the <a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a> app screen.
</p>
<p>Players state intentions.
</p>
<p>The storyteller declares which characteristics or attributes are
relevant to this specific situation.
</p>
<p>Calculate an &quot;Us&quot; value by totalling contributions
from all friendlies.
</p>
<p>Sum all opposition from adversaries as a &quot;Them&quot; value.
</p>
<p>Enter these numbers onto the <a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>
app screen to determine target number and dice to roll.
</p>
<p>All participating players simultaneously roll <em>one</em> dice each after saying,
“Ready, steady, roll!”</p>
<p>All players progress if <strong>any</strong> player meets or beats target
roll.</p>
<p>Otherwise players suffer setbacks, give ground, take losses or
progress with consequences.</p>
<p>Setbacks, losses and changing odds may prompt further rolls.</p>

<h2 id="us_and_them_values">Us and Them values</h2>
<p>For difficult actions the storyteller normally declares
a characteristic (or a choice of characteristics) appropriate to
the current activity, such as a contest of strength, dexterity or
intelligence.
</p>
<p>One way to calculate Us and Them values involves summing each
side's characteristic levels.
</p>
<p>For example, add up all strength levels on either side of a
brawl, or total each side's dexterity levels in a shoot out, or sum
each faction's intelligence levels in a battle of wits.
</p>
<p>Indeed you may enter any comparable measure such as number of troops
  in opposing armies or ships in each fleet, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to competition between individuals or groups,
<a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>
can model any contention where numerical values express relative
prowess, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>tech levels </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>social status </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>shock level vs sanity </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../index.html">Enter</a>
these comparable Us and Them values as non-zero positive numbers.
</p>
<p>Optionally enter additional <a href="#advantages_section">advantages</a>
unique to either side.</p>

<h2 id="difficulty_levels">Difficulty levels</h2>
<p>Contested actions normally involve totalling comparable
<a href="#us_and_them_values">competency
levels</a> for both Us and Them.</p>
<p>For passive opposition, when only the prevailing environment
obstructs player progress, storytellers may enter a difficulty
level as a Them value.
</p>
<p>An easy way to gauge difficulty level involves estimating the
number of people required to normally attempt a task and
multiplying by ten.
</p>
<p>A task 1 person might attempt gives a Them value of 10 (ie 1×10 =
10).
</p>
<p>A task 2 people normally attempt, such as climbing a dangerous
mountain, gives a Them value of 20 (ie 2×10 = 20).
</p>
<p>A task usually pursued by teams of ten people, such as securing
sensitive data from hackers, gives a Them value of 100 (ie 10×10 =
100).
</p>
<p>All Them values generate some chance of setback which minimises
the need for precision. So, if in doubt, give Them a value of 10.
</p>

<h2 id="advantages_section">Advantages</h2>
<p>With <a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>,
if one side holds a unique advantage then enter 1 as their
advantage value.
</p>
<p>Any number of multiple advantages can increase this score.
However subsequent advantages yield diminishing returns.
</p>
<p>Opposing advantages cancel out. So only consider differing
quantities of advantages. For example two advantages on both sides
equals no advantage to either side. Only enter uniquely superior
advantages.</p>
<p>Fewer advantages are better. Ideally avoid using advantages. If
necessary, try awarding only one advantage.
</p>

<h2 id="mass_action">Mass action</h2>
<p>From bronze age armies to clashing space fleets, <a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>
handles any comparable opponents.
</p>
<p>For example if your space fleet with 5 capital ships faces an
enemy with 7 capital ships then Us=5 and Them=7.
</p>
<p>Similarly if your 100 soldiers face 80 enemies then Us=100 and
Them=80. But if your soldiers fight with twice the skill of normal
troops you may apply an automatic force-multiplier of two and enter
Us=200 and Them=80.
</p>

<h2 id="ambush">Ambush</h2>
<p>Perceiving hidden threats normally utilises dexterity.
</p>
<p>Surprise often yields an advantage.
</p>
<p>A clever ambush might even give two or more advantages.
</p>
<p>At the storyteller's discretion, an unwitting party taken by
surprise may suffer immediate setbacks, and a sly ambush could
inflict arbitrary casualties by employing convincing camouflage,
mechanised weaponry and surprise.
</p>

<h2 id="interpreting_dice">Interpreting dice</h2>
<p>Allocating each player different coloured dice means a
storyteller can interpret the numbers rolled and narrate individual
contributions to an overall result.
</p>
<p>With <a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>,
the whole party progresses if <strong>any</strong> player meets or beats the
target roll.
</p>
<p>Otherwise characters suffer setbacks, give ground, take losses
or <em>progress with consequences</em> where the party might still
progress but with negative or unforeseen consequences.
</p>

<h2 id="party_progress">Party progress</h2>
<p>In <a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>,
if <strong>any</strong> player meets or beats the target number then the
<strong>whole</strong> party typically enacts their will or achieves their
stated intentions.
</p>
<p>Party progress during armed conflict normally forces enemies to
suffer losses or give ground.
</p>
<p>Alternatively the storyteller may dictate the exact nature of
party progress or combatant players could pick from a list, such as
forcing an enemy to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>retreat</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>surrender</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>suffer hurt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>die</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>disarm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>collapse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>startle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>flee</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setbacks">Setbacks</h2>
<p>Setbacks generally frustrate party intentions.
</p>
<p>Also characteristic levels for strength, dexterity or
intelligence may reduce if characters lose a fight or their
adversaries get the jump on them.
</p>
<p>If the party suffers a setback in combat then players must give
ground or suffer casualties. If everyone agrees, then identify a
suitable victim to take damage such as an inexperienced or
peripheral character, or someone with low dexterity, or the bravest
person who took point. Alternatively, allocate damage randomly.</p>
<p>Taking a hit from potentially lethal weapons, like daggers or
guns, typically reduces a character's strength level by ten.
Whereas a mauling in unarmed combat might reduce strength levels by
five.
</p>
<p>Where possible resolve damage in ways consistent with your
story, for example a duellist scars cheeks or pierces organs,
boxers knock-out and assassins slit throats.</p>
<p>Wounded characters tend to die without treatment.</p>
<p>Any characteristic at zero equals incapacitated and entirely
vulnerable to capture or coup de grâce.
</p>
<p>Armour can keep characteristics from slipping below zero,
otherwise negative characteristics means death.
</p>
<p>Optionally, superior weapons obsoleting armour, like machine
guns or artillery, can create kill-zones with random chances of
wounding or killing.
</p>

<h2 id="reroll_tokens">Re-roll tokens</h2>
<p>Begin each session by issuing d4 re-roll tokens to each player.
</p>
<p>Spending one re-roll token allows <strong>every</strong> player involved
to instantly re-roll their dice.
</p>

<h1 id="d99">d99</h1>
<p>Consider using d99 for random events like winning roulette or
surviving artillery barrages.
</p>
<p>Determine a target number by predicting or modelling the
percentage chances of an event occurring.
</p>
<p>Then roll <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation#Percentile_dice_.28d.25.29">percentile
dice</a> where 99 gives the worst result and 00 the best.
</p>
<p>Thus an event occurs if players roll equal or under the target
number.
</p>
<p>(Note: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation#Percentile_dice_.28d.25.29">percentile
dice</a> use 2 ten-sided dice. One numbered 00, 10, 20 ... 80, 90 for tens and one
numbered 0 to 9 for units.)</p>

<h1 id="time">Time</h1>
<p>Unopposed actions simply progress in a reasonable time.
</p>
<p>Let narrative rhythm direct the period of story-time covered
between dice rolls.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Resolving the tide of a mass
  battle might cover a few hours. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Initial losses in a skirmish
  might occur in seconds. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Some science-fiction challenges might conclude in a split
  second. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Tactical situations (eg escapes, rescues or skirmishes) can
resolve very quickly especially if players describe broad
intentions like &quot;escape&quot;, &quot;rescue&quot; or &quot;defend&quot;.
</p>

<h1 id="generating_characters">Generating characters</h1>
<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<p>Strength + Dexterity + Intelligence = 50; max 30, min 8.
</p>
<p>Distribute 50 over Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence.
</p>
<p>Ten equates to average human. Hence a characteristic of twenty
equals twice the human average.
</p>
<p>Strength includes many physical attributes like health,
hardiness and vigour.
</p>
<p>Dexterity also covers quick reactions and perception.
</p>
<p>Intelligence refers to all mental or intellectual attributes
such as knowledge, cognition and resolve.
</p>
<p>Specific settings or genres may also suggest additional
characteristics such as preparedness or sanity.
</p>
<h3>Specials</h3>
<p>Choose a special expertise or item agreed with your fellow
players. Actions involving your specialism may allow you a free
re-roll or some other benefit.
</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>In simple terms what motives your character to adventure?
</p>
<h3>Training and equipment</h3>
<p>Agree which activities require training and crucial equipment.
</p>

<h1 id="character_sheet">Character sheet</h1>
<p>Record your character on a character sheet.</p>
<p>Include: Name, Appearance, Specials, Motivation, Background, Training and Equipment.</p>
<p>Plus characteristic level and current value for Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence.
<p>Example character sheet: agent</p>
<p>Name: Harry</p>
<p>Appearance: middle-aged man with darting eyes, wearing a crumpled
blue suit, long dark coat and wide-brimmed hat.</p>
<p>Specials: surveillance </p>
<p>Motivation: curiosity </p>
<p>Background: intelligence service </p>
<p>Training: planting bugs</p>
<p>Equipment: wiretap </p>
<p>Characteristic levels and current values:-</p>
<p>Strength 15 (currently 5) </p>
<p>Dexterity 15 </p>
<p>Intelligence 20</p>

<h1 id="up_to_nine_players">Up to nine players</h1>
<p>With six or more players, consider breaking your group into
multiple smaller games.</p>
<p><a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>
functions best with under five players.</p>
<p>For unavoidably large groups, please see <a href="http://www.dancewith.co.uk/tabletop2018/usvsthem9p.html">Us-vs-Them
for up to nine players</a>.</p>

<h1 id="offline_play">Offline play</h1>
<p>For offline play either save our <a href="../index.html">web
pages</a> locally, or copy our stand-alone alternatives for <a href="http://www.dancewith.co.uk/tabletop2018/usvsthem9p.html">up
to nine players</a> or our recommended stand-alone page for <a href="http://www.dancewith.co.uk/tabletop2018/usvsthem.html">up
to six players</a>.</p>

<h1 id="advancement">Advancement</h1>
<p>Levelling-up</p>
<p>If you attended last session, or completed a chapter, then add 1
to a characteristic level. Alternatively, with everyone's
agreement, gain a specialism based on experience.</p>
<p>Optionally, to help a newcomer catch up, the character with
the lowest combined total (strength plus dexterity plus
intelligence levels) may receive 2 level-up increments.</p>
<p><a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>
divides &quot;Us values&quot; by &quot;Them values&quot; to create
a ratio. Hence common attributes cancel out. For example, if both
sides wield shields then the effect of shields cancels out.
Therefore, <a href="../index.html">Us-vs-Them</a>
scales indefinitely for antagonists and protagonists of ever
increasing prowess.</p>

<h1 id="game_mastery">Game mastery</h1>
<p>The storyteller (or Game Master or GM) leads the plot and also holds the final word on
adjudicating rules.</p>

<h2 id="storyteller_advice">Storyteller advice</h2>
<p>Wherever possible captivate players with descriptions of actions, places and people. </p>
<p>With a bias towards progressing a shared story, only call for dice rolls
if you can think of interesting consequences. </p>
<p>Players frequently pursue unforeseen avenues so avoid becoming too attached
to your plans. Consider leaving space to invent supporting
characters based on player choices. Full details can describe supporting
characters, or treat them as simple adversaries overcome by a
single dice roll or interaction. </p>
<p>Players normally adventure without fully knowing all your preparations
so you can improvise without risking disappointment. If, by chance,
an ad-lib idea proves unconvincing then simply change track by quickly
jumping to your next spontaneous thought. </p>
<p>Everyone reacting to each other's imagination helps create a shared narrative.
The best stories often emerge during play so try building on player contributions
by saying “Yes, and...” </p>
<p>Maximise inclusion and enjoyment.</p>
